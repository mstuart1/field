Designing a data sheet/data entry file

The data sheet and the data entry file should be as similar to each other as possible.

## Google sheets has been a great way to enter data.  

### Pros  
- backed up in the cloud with version control  
- multiple people can enter data simultaneously into one file  
- Can make available offline **in advance**

### Cons  
- need internet connectivity to co-work on document
- need internet connectivity to pull data into R with script, otherwise need to plan ahead before losing internet.

The google sheet we've been using in the Leyte project has some **data validation** built in to catch data entry errors.
This is done by selecting the column, click on data, then data validation.  In the popup, in the Criteria box, choose list from a range, and select the range from the codes sheet.  For example, for dive_type on the diveinfo sheet, for the criteria, I entered codes!B33:B39.
