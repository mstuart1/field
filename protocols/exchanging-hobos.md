How to HOBO
================

HOBO temperature loggers are positioned off the coast of Visca and replaced every year.

Clean the hobos by running under water and scrubbing with a test tube brush. If they resist, let them dry out for a month or a year and try again.

Download software for the HOBOs
[Windows](https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/software/hoboware/HOBOware_Free_Setup.exe)

1.  Connect the base station to the computer.
2.  Connect the hobo to the base station.

5.  First device &gt; launch "now" and change interval to 30 minutes; second device launch "on time" 15 minutes later with a 30 minute interval.
