## Mayoral Visits and University President Courtesy call

The first full day in Leyte, visit the Mayors offices of Albuera and Baybay.  If the PIC forms still need to be signed, bring those along.  Also take a photo of researcher with the office staff to document the visit.  

Email the university president before departing the US to arrange a courtesy call for the same day.

## Standard dive gear
For each diver pack:

* Wetsuit/diveskin
+ Fins
+ Booties
+ BC
+ Regulator
+ Weights (these can be left on the boat)
+ 1 tank per planned dive

## HOBO retrieval and replacement

As a first dive of the season, replace the HOBO temperature data loggers at Visca.  This is a nice way to check out gear close to the marine lab and do a test dive to make sure everything is working as expected.

Before the dive,

* connect the base station to the computer
* connect the hobo to the base station
+ Open the software
+ Click “launch device” first icon on the left 
+ First device launch now and change interval to 30 minutes; 
+ second device launch on time 15 minutes later.
+ Take a screen shot of the launch.

In addition to standard dive gear, bring:

* gloves for handling hydroid covered PVC housing
+ scissors for cutting present zipties
+ launched HOBO sensors
+ fresh zipies
+ slate with paper and pencil for noting which serial number HOBO went in which location, and which was taken from which location.

The first HOBO is located just south of the resort tower at 10.74373, 124.78668.
The second HOBO is located about 10m to the SW, 10.74364, 124.78665.

Turn of the old HOBOS by clicking “read out device”.  Save the files.

Clean the old hobos by running under water and scrubbing with a test tube brush.  If they resist, let them dry out for a month or a year and try again.
