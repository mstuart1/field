Take the boat as close as possible to the pre-planned coordinates for the beginning of the transect.  All transects should run as close to due north as possible.  It is ok to veer away from due north in order stay on the reef or if it is discovered that the tape is a few degrees away from due north once the tape has been laid.

For permanent transects, nails and bottle floats have been secured to the reef at the positions where quadrat photos are to be taken.  This helps when laying the transect and should be followed, even if the direction is not due north.  However, the zero point should be at the south end of the transect and the 25m point should be at the north end of the transect.  For permanent transects it is ok to adjust the tape so that the numbers on the tape match up to the bottle/nail marker locations; this should be done before starting the survey.

Once the team is in the water, tech 1 descends while tech 2 swims with gps in hand (out of the water) to the exact location of the beginning of the transect (Coke bottles mark fixed transects).  Tech 1 secures meter tape to the substrate and begins to roll out 25m while tech 2 descends to the starting point and finds a place to rest the quadrat.

Protocol for sand sites?
Color calibration of photos?

Tech 1 returns from securing the meter tape and both wait quietly for 5 minutes to pass while fish return to a normal state after the disturbance of tech 1’s passage.

At the end of the 5 minute rest period, tech 1 swims along the transect at a pace that will take 20 minutes to reach the 25m mark, counting fish that are visible within 2.5 m of either side of the tape.

Staying at a distance behind tech 1 that will not disturb fish, tech 2 rests the quadrat at pre-planned distances along the measuring tape, with the bottom left corner of the transect on the tape at the determined mark (for example, if a quadrat photo needs to be taken at the 3m mark, the bottom left corner of the quadrat is on the 3m mark and the edge of the quadrat is parallel to the tape), tech 2 photographs the quadrat, making sure to move the point of focus around the interior of the quadrat to make sure all corals have been captured in focus.

Tech 2 then swims down to the substrate while the quadrat is still in position and draws the corals that are found within the quadrat and identifies the 6 most abundant genera present.

After taking the quadrat photos, tech 2 lays out the 5m rugosity chain, starting at the determined mark mentioned above and drapes the chain along the transect tape, following the topography of the reef.  Tech 2 records the number on the measuring tape where the chain ends.  Tech 2 is careful to never interfere with tech 1’s fish survey during these measurements.

Tech 2 repeats this for a total of 5 quadrants along the transect.

When tech 1 reaches the 25 m mark, he swims back along the transect at a pace that will take him 5 minutes to reach the starting point, recording any benthic species of note (trochus, urchins, anemones, See Codes sheet on the GPSSurveys.xls data sheet) within the 2.5m range on either side of the tape.

When tech 2 has completed the 5 quadrats, tech 1 is still usually swimming the invert survey, so tech 2 begins to roll up the transect tape and return to the starting point.  Because winding up tape while carrying the quadrat can be ungainly, tech 1 swims back to tech 2 as soon as the invert survey is done, takes the tape, and finishes winding it up.  Both divers ascend to the boat and move to the next transect point.
