title: "Map anemones from 2012"

Many anems in 2012 lack anem_ids.  I need to know where they are so that I can determine how to split the dive between N and S Magbangon so I need to plot the locations on the map.

```{r}
source("scripts/field_helpers.R")

leyte <- read_db("Leyte")

# pull dives for date range
  dive <- leyte %>% 
    tbl("diveinfo") %>% 
    select(dive_table_id, date, site, gps) %>% 
    rename(unit = gps) %>% 
    collect() %>% 
    filter(grepl("2012", date), 
           site == "Magbangon")
  
  anem <- leyte %>% 
    tbl("anemones") %>% 
    # get only anemones that were observed during our desired dive
    filter(dive_table_id %in% dive$dive_table_id) %>% 
    # reduce the number of columns - these anemones don't have anem_ids, so not including that column
    select(dive_table_id, anem_table_id, obs_time) %>%
    collect() 
 
   anem <- left_join(anem, dive, by = "dive_table_id") 
  rm(dive)
  
  anem <- anem %>% 
    mutate(date_time = force_tz(ymd_hms(stringr::str_c(date, obs_time, sep = " ")),tzone = "Asia/Manila")) %>% 
  # convert times to UTC
  mutate(gpx_time = with_tz(date_time, tzone = "UTC"))
  
   anem <- anem %>% 
    mutate(month = month(gpx_time), 
      day = day(gpx_time), 
      hour = hour(gpx_time), 
      min = minute(gpx_time), 
      sec = second(gpx_time), 
      year = year(gpx_time))
  
 # get table of lat lon data ####
  gpx <- leyte %>% 
    tbl("GPX") %>% 
    filter(unit %in% anem$unit, ) %>% 
    collect() %>% 
     filter(grepl("2012", time)) %>% 
    mutate(month = month(time), 
      day = day(time), 
      hour = hour(time), 
      min = minute(time), 
      sec = second(time), 
      year = year(time), 
      lat = as.character(lat), # to prevent from importing as factors
      lon = as.character(lon), 
      time = as.character(time)) 
  
  #### WAIT ####
  
    # find matches for times to assign lat long - there are more than one set of seconds (sec.y) that match
  temp <- left_join(anem, gpx, by = c("unit", "month", "day", "hour", "min", "year")) %>%
    mutate(lat = as.numeric(lat), 
      lon = as.numeric(lon)) %>% 
    select(-contains("sec"))

    # calculate a mean lat lon for each anem observation (currently there are 4 because a reading was taken every 15 seconds)
  coord <- temp %>%
    group_by(anem_table_id) %>% # id should be referring to one row of the data
    summarise(mlat = mean(lat, na.rm = TRUE),
      mlon = mean(lon, na.rm = T))   
  
anem <- left_join(anem, coord, by = "anem_table_id") %>% 
  select(anem_table_id, mlat, mlon)

readr::write_csv(anem, path = "2012_mag_anems.csv")
   
```
