# find a way to merge the 2017 anem observations with the 2017 clownfish observations

# combine in one table, then take the anem columns for the anem table and the fish columns for the fish table - define gps's. define times (anem_time, fish_time)

# for an anemone observation, if APCL are listed, did we catch these fish, for each fish we captured remove one from the anem_obs - also for each anemone observation, split the fish out into individual rows (have done this since the beginning of the study, regardless of species)
