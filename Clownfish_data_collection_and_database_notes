# Notes for Analyses

## Fish observed but not caught
* If there were clearly 2 large breeding adults on an anemone but couldnâ€™t catch one, despite trying, that is sometimes that is noted in the data and could be used to estimate proportion of breeding adults caught. Likely not recorded 2014 and earlier. Could tell if a fish was observed and not caught in the database by filtering for large fish without sample or tag ids.
## Tail color
* Some fish have a yellow tail with points but are clearly too small to be a breeding female. This was likely handled differently (marked as YR, marked as YP, or something else) in different years and possibly across different observers. See more details about how this was handled in 2018 here.
* Some fish have some orange on their tails but not clear that they are a breeding male. In 2018, Joyce (JJO) noted these fish with OLOT (orange line on tail) in the notes. Not sure how they were recorded in previous years.
* In 2012, fish were only marked as O, W, or Y (so no YP or YR distinction). Based on the sizes of fish marked Y (min=3.1, max=11.8cm), looks like both YR and YP included in Y.

# 2012 Field Season
* Tail colors only designated as O, W, Y. Y includes both YR and YP, based on size (min Y fish = 3.1cm, max = 11.8cm).
