# Notes for Analyses

## Fish observed but not caught
* If there were clearly 2 large breeding adults on an anemone but couldn’t catch one, despite trying, that is sometimes that is noted in the data and could be used to estimate proportion of breeding adults caught. Likely not recorded 2014 and earlier. Could tell if a fish was observed and not caught in the database by filtering for large fish without sample or tag ids.
## Tail color
* Some fish have a yellow tail with points but are clearly too small to be a breeding female. This was likely handled differently (marked as YR, marked as YP, or something else) in different years and possibly across different observers. See more details about how this was handled in 2018 [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWzReRgfI9JXVbHDzfd09vE_4pidfr-m5ykRP_T-Q7M).
* Some fish have some orange on their tails but not clear that they are a breeding male. In 2018, Joyce (JJO) noted these fish with OLOT (orange line on tail) in the notes. Not sure how they were recorded in previous years.
* In 2012, fish were only marked as O, W, or Y (so no YP or YR distinction). Based on the sizes of fish marked Y (min=3.1, max=11.8 cm), looks like both YR and YP included in Y.

## Anemone tags
* Winter 2015 field season was an anemone survey season where all anemones with APCL seen were tagged with plastic anemone tags - two tags, one on each side of the anemone
* Starting in spring 2015, newly-tagged anemones were tagged with metal anemone tags, rather than plastic ones. If only one plastic anemone tag remained on a previously-tagged anemone and the anemone still had APCL on it, the tag was replaced with a new tag, which was metal starting in spring 2015.
* Tags 2001 and above are metal. Tags below 2000 are plastic.
* Starting in 2018 and somewhat in 2017, tagged anemones that had APCL and were only tagged with a plastic tag were re-tagged with a metal tag, with the tag_id of the plastic tag noted as an old_anem_id when readable.

## Site hulls
* Site hulls were created by Mario and Malin using GPS swim data from 2012-2014 seasons
* In later seasons, new areas of sites (particularly Haina and Sitio Baybayon) were found outside of the hulls and sampled.
* Michelle created maps of the sites based on hulls to guide sampling in 2018 field season.

# 2012 Field Season
* Tail colors only designated as O, W, Y. Y includes both YR and YP, based on size (min Y fish = 3.1 cm, max = 11.8 cm).
* Anemones were only tagged at Visca, though APCL were sampled and caught at other sites.
* All dives were transect dives, this information is not preserved through divetype in the database.

# 2013 Field Season

# 2014 Field Season
* MRS did not regularly record empty anemones (especially Sitio Baybayon, Wangag, Palanas) due to miscommunication with MLP.
* Temperature loggers set to log every 30 min, but the pair was not offset by 15 min as in other years
* Impression that we missed the large clownfish on anemones because they would hide

# 2015 Field Season
* Two field seasons! January (surveys only) and May (surveys and collections)
* Northern Magbangon has an enormous number of anemones and A. clarkii
* January: first PIT tags deployed
* May: only went to the 5 anemones that Shem knows about at Visca, rather than a broader swim
* May: dredging the river by Palanas and Magbangon: poor visibility
* May: began using metal anemone tags

# 2016 Field Season
* PIT tag reader housing problems; GPS malfunction problems
* DiveInfo sheet Notes indicates when anemone survey was not complete (e.g., bad viz, fast dive, etc.)
* Tony trained Michelle, Malin, and Cecil on catching clownfish
* We probably missed many small APCL: got scared while catching
* MRS impression that too many fish came in at once, and weren’t matched well to anemone

# 2017 Field Season
* Time spent on deploying/retrieving oceanographic drifters and tilt current meter
* Settlement monitoring and relocation trial experiment
* KC notes would frequently record tagged anemone, but not the # of fish or their sizes
* KC notes frequently did not record sizes of non-APCL species
* Magbangon and Cabatoan were never diveable: too much sediment from the rivers
* Haina is really big; found new area with really good coral. outside the “hull” we had drawn
* Many new anemones tagged 
* Some replacement of plastic anemone tags with metal tags (if anemone still had APCL) even if both plastic tags were present
* New survey system: anemone surveyor (KC), catcher (GS), processor (MRS). Two datasheets: one for surveyor, one for processor.

# 2018 Field Season
* See Safety and Emergency Protocols document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFxBrV9YBi0idd4ExpuBzn4b2sYEQj6c2PCNpdQUjik/edit?usp=sharing)
* Details of 2018 field protocols, events, and decisions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWzReRgfI9JXVbHDzfd09vE_4pidfr-m5ykRP_T-Q7M)
* did NOT record every anemone systematically this year
* Used maps underwater to target known anemones and parts of reef
* Despite hard searching, often could not find a tag or an anemone. Tag and anemone loss rates appear high.
* Some sites lost all APCL and/or all anemones (Poroc San Flower, Gabas), Hicgop lost fish and anemones DURING field season
* Saw wrasses eating eggs while clownfish being tagged
* Fish this year seemed more stressed after being handled
* Protocol to re-tag tagged anemones with APCL with only plastic tags with metal tags (even if both plastic tags were still present), though might not have been completely consistently applied.
